# GettingAndCleaningData
Course project for Coursera Getting And Cleaning Data course

The script, run_analysis.R, processes UCI HAR dataset to generate a tidy dataset, with averages of the mean and standard deviation data grouped by activity and subject.

The script makes the following assumptions:
* The UCI HAR zip file has been downloaded
* The zip file has been extracted into the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder under the project folder
* The "UCI HAR Dataset" folder has retained the folder structure present in the zip file
